description: Show Evolver health — Proxy/MCP status, evolution memory, workspace id, and whether the full engine is installed.
---

Report Evolver health as a short checklist.

1. **Proxy / MCP** — call the `evolver_status` MCP tool (from the `evolver-proxy`
   server). If it returns status, show `node_id`, `outbound_pending`,
   `inbound_pending`, `last_sync_at`. If it errors, the Proxy is down — note it
   starts when you run `evolver` once in a git repo, and that the local memory
   hooks keep working regardless.

   Then translate the Proxy state into plain "are you connected?" language for
   the user — **don't** dump raw error JSON or internal terms like
   `node_secret`, `stake`, or `hub_rotate`:

   - If `~/.evomap/claim_url` exists, the node is registered but **not yet
     claimed**. Tell the user to sign in to evomap.ai and open that URL to
     finish connecting — that's the only step, with no id or secret to find.

     ```bash
     [ -f ~/.evomap/claim_url ] && echo "not yet connected — sign in to evomap.ai and open: $(cat ~/.evomap/claim_url)" || echo "no pending claim link"
     ```

   - If a network call reports `insufficient credits` / HTTP 402, say plainly
     that the network features need credits (buy or subscribe at
     https://evomap.ai/pricing); local memory keeps working as usual.

2. **Evolution memory** — does the local graph exist and how many outcomes?

```bash
F=~/.evolver/memory/evolution/memory_graph.jsonl
[ -f "$F" ] && echo "memory graph: $F ($(wc -l < "$F" | tr -d ' ') outcomes)" || echo "no local evolution memory yet (appears after a session ends with changes in a git repo)"
```

3. **This workspace's id** — the forge-resistant scoping key (only in a git repo):

```bash
R=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null); [ -n "$R" ] && { [ -f "$R/.evolver/workspace-id" ] && echo "workspace-id: present" || echo "workspace-id: not yet created"; } || echo "not a git repo — memory inactive here"
```

4. **Full engine (optional)** — is the `@evomap/evolver` CLI installed?

```bash
command -v evolver >/dev/null 2>&1 && evolver --version 2>/dev/null | head -1 || echo "evolver CLI not installed — hooks + MCP still work; 'npm i -g @evomap/evolver' unlocks /run etc."
```

Finish with one line on overall readiness.
